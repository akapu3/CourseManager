# WellnessFirst
WellnessFirst is a wellness program that is aims to help people improve 
their mental and physical health. The program will be divided into 2 sections,
mental health and physical health. Each section contains various features that
will help the user improve their mental or physical health. This program focuses
at students in high school and university however, it is versatile enough to be 
used by anyone looking to improve their health.

Now more than, people all around the world are not
only accepting the importance of mental health but 
also actively taking responsibility for their mental 
as well as physical health. Furthermore, it is only 
recently that people have come to understand and accept 
the gravity of mental disorders such as anxiety, depression, 
and OCD. However, trying to work on one’s mental and physical
health can be overwhelming. One google search will show you 
hundreds of websites that all tell you different ways to 
improve your mental health. However, there are very few that 
provide a place to implement those methods and support you as
you embark on your self-improvement journey. As someone who 
has struggled with anxiety in the past, not having that support 
can make implementing those ways very difficult. This is why I’m
interested in creating a program like this.
