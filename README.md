Being a university students comes with its share of stress and worries. Most of them 
are surrounded around completing assignments on time. Because of that face that students
are taking multiple courses, and each of them have several assignments associated with them. 
As a result, students get overwhelmed and often very anxiousness about their assignments. 
As a student, I have experienced my share of anxiety related to assignments. By creating this
course manager, I hope to relive some of the pressure and anxiety experienced by students.
